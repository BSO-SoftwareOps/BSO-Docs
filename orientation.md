# Red Stars

**Protocol for a cooperative Red Star**

Before going in to an RS
* Decide which corp your group will be running in. Consult the pinned messages in #bso-rs for when and how to do this.
* Declare any liabilities before the scan (e.g. severely wounded BS or low hydro).
* Declare if you need to complete an objective. Everyone should help you complete it or at least not interfere.

**The general rules for sharing artifacts are:**

* Work together as a team. Even if you lose ships, continue helping out as best you can with what you have.
* Communicate well and thoroughly.
* Ping any loosed interceptors.
* We are not PRSS. Default mode is offering full team assistance, not soloing your corner. See point 2.

**The general rules for combat are:**

* Loot as many arts as you are able to during the RS.
* If you ended up with many more arts than someone else (for whatever reason) we encourage you to offer to share them post-run (via diplo or low-level RS). This offer is mandatory in RS7+.
* Running away and not dying is always better than standing strong and wiping. Alive BS are more useful that dead ones, even if you didnt solo that planet you were trying. This becomes more and more critical the higher up in RSes you go.
If you are an Ally, We require you to abide by BSO rules or you're reverted to guest status. If in doubt about anything, ask!


**Red Star 6**

Just like RS5 but with extra collosus and destroyers. Focus on the destroy planets first, EMP the collosus to reset their laser and kill 'em.

-----------|----|------------
EMP        | any| 2


**Red Star 7**

Welcome to bombers, if you have not turned on the heat map, turn it on now. Bombers fire rockets into all adjacent sectors and a rocket hit will quickly cause you to wipe, which is why we require Blast shield. 
Suggested order of engagement: Target planets destroyers are going to --> Bombers > Collosus > Rest

**Red Star 8**

Introducing the Phoenix, it packs an area shield, a strong dual laser, and moves around its sector to protect cerbs closest to battleships. You can use this to your advantage, ideally you want to trap a Phoneix just of out firing range as you kill a bomber to drain its area shield and then move into the kill.
Suggested order of engagement: Target planets destroyers are going to --> Phoenix > Bombers > Collosus > Rest

**Red Star 9**

Ahh yes, the best RS to be at in game from a gain / hydro spent perspective. You will be here a while, enjoy it. The Storm is the new enemy here and it fires DARTS in a giant radius at all ships in range as it circles the planet. Follow similar engagement to RS8 in regards to Phoenix Area shield. Be careful with your barriers as stacked Storm darts will kill you VERY quick if you dont time barrier dropping right. Order of priority: Storm > Phoenix > Bomber > Collosus.

**RS10**

Say hi to ghosts, they will spawn every 40seconds , then every 20 after 15 minutes. They take 30sec to spawn and will follow the closest player ship as interceptors but they will use the player ship position as a waypoint, no matter if it's moving or not.

__Phase 1__ -- The Clear

All players will focus on catching the destroyers and clearing planets, then enough additional sectors that everyone's influence bar is blue or very close to it. Order of priority: Storm > Phoenix > Bomber > Collosus.

__Phase 2__ -- The Collection

*Check with other players before starting this*; players will each pick a planet to defend from ghosts, and transports will teleport in to load. It is expected that you keep an area shield up and TW on the planet to speed up this process. **Mine at your own risk; transports are the priority.** If you need a croid, please inform the other players at this point. It is better to save those for the second transport trip when there will be BS free to watch them.

# White Stars

**Basic White Star Tutorial by McChaos**

Simple as they may seem, White Stars are complex and highly strategic. Every bit of input is important. It is a team game where there is no room for any I do what I want with my ship attitude. 

This brief training is based on mistakes seen every single week within our matches.

**Prior to the match**

1. **Use the -!opt-in- command** with your WS tag to gain access to the right channels. [Do it fast! Save your commanders the extra work]
2. ****Follow the loadout** : commanders spend time on strategical decisions. Any modification should be approved before changed. [Much easier to blame the commander in case of loss, rather than your lack of attention when you have the right modules]
3. **Warp your WS battleship in your Diplo before scan** : no need for the enemy to come peek at our strategy by looking at our modules. Preferable if it’s available. 
4. **A note on sanctuary**: If you want to put sanctuary on your BS, do not answer competitive on the poll, you aren’t competitive you are casual. [since the recent update in rewards, you can lose 2 BS and the match and still come out even]


**During Prep Period**

1. **Discuss your ideas in public**: commanders wonder which RP to pick, which sectors to mine, etc. Your input might enlighten the decision-making. [Participate for Heaven’s Sake or don’t sign up!!]
2. **Don’t be Frustrated**: Final decisions will not always reflect your input. But take satisfaction that it has been considered.  [train yourself and inquire why it hasn’t been retained. The more you know!]
3. **Learn to read**: Once the orders are posted, follow its instructions to a T. When uncertain, ping your commanders for clarification. [a lost art, reading is a useful tool to know what you need to do!!]
4. **Warp in as late as possible**: Hiding our strategy is desirable. Set an alarm for yourself to warp in as late as possible before bed or end of prep period. [Commander orders take precedence over this if they require you to warp in]
5. **Pre-Burn your damn Shields!!!!!** : burning one third off your shields before warping in should be standard unless required otherwise. [this isn’t rocket science, focus on what you need to do before warping in!!]
6. **Confirm your Orders**: Once you are set, ping a commander to confirm your targets are as expected. [Prep is the only part of the match we can fully control, better make the best of it!]
7. **Reach the maximum # of orders** : if all your orders in TM aren’t used, you should probably put more input in. The earlier we see things in TM, the better we can plan. [and set yourself a timer to check in after WS starts to set 2 more order]

**The Match**

1. **Keep an eye on the match**: show your interest and spend some time everyday looking at the match. Share your analysis, we can never have enough ideas and brainstorming. [if you haven’t spoken in the channels for 24 hours, you aren’t competitive, you are casual]
2. **Answer pings in a timely manner** : If you aren’t set to afk, you should be able to answer pings within 15 minutes to an hour. Though not required, serious players give their phone numbers to their commanders in case of emergencies if possible. [1 mistake can change a whole match and we play to win. Don’t be the guy that screws the team!!]]
3. **If you die** : set your timer on ship return with the -!wsship- command ,(-!wsship b 17 hours) so that your commanders know when you are back. [this could be the difference maker in changing the tide of a game, DO IT!]
4. **Before going to sleep or AFK for more than 1 hour**  : 15 minutes before going afk, ping the channel to see if there is anything requested from you, as we need time to check your position & possible actions. [No one has eyes everywhere at all times, be responsible for your ships and make your absence known!]
5. **Setting the afk command**: use -!afk X hours Reason- [you can sleep, but we need to know when, to know the tools available to us in your area of the map]
6. **Coming back from AFK** : Read discord first. Find out what has been requested in your absence. If any doubt, ping the channel for recommandations on your actions. When decided, get in game and make the moves in TM. [Don’t blindly send your ships to where you think it would be best, you just missed 8 hours of WS :zzz:, you don’t know]

**Managing Opponents Corp Hoping for RS**
1. If ws opponent joins your Corp they cannot see time machine as a member. Senior and officer has not been tested. 

2. If a **non WS opponent** joins Corp they **can see time machine as a member**.  this can be a member of the opponent corp that is not in this particular ws, or another linked player / alt, etc.

3. If time machine is not open when you leave Corp, you cannot open/use it anymore. 

4. If time machine is open when you leave Corp, **you continue to be able to use it indefinitely** i.e. until you purposely close it (or hades get disconnected)
Commanders, be thorough when setting opponents - include everyone in the opponent corp (as opposed to only the players in your particular ws), include everyone that you know is connected somehow. because when they come to bso for RS, they **are able** to peek and gain intelligence. it only takes a moment to perceive key moves.
