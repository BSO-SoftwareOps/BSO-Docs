# The History of BSO

## The Origin

The Black Star Order server was created on October 14, 2017, as a merger between 3 in-game corporations: **Final** led by __McChaos__, **ENFORCERS** led by __Lunareo__ & **Pro Casuals** led by __Psengath__. __Angrydogies__ and __Nyklon__ were also elected to be leaders of this new organization. At the end of that same October, __Warpathian SI__ finished talks with leadership, integrating his corp **Capella Corps** into this new conglomerate. Soon after, a vote was taken for the name of this new conglomerate - **Black Star Order** was chosen. Soon after, a flagship corp of a similar name was created to house the top members of the conglomerate.

## Initial Growth

The first merger BSO came upon was with the top corp **LID Corps**, run by __Dr. Death__. 11 members were assimilated in, and __Dr. Death__ joined later on after starting the first Hades' Star banking service, the IGBS. Then in early 2018 BSO expanded further, bringing themselves up to a total of eight corps, integrating **MastersOfChaos**, **Space Penguins** & **New Horizons** all at once, totaling an astounding 189 members. However, these new additions, as well as **Capella Corps**, soon amicably split due to cultural differences, leaving BSO with four corporations. Members of the then top corporation **Cipher Two** soon merged into the conglomerate. Following the departure of much of the conglomerate, BSO leadership decided to open two member populated corps: Dauntless & Obsidian, as well as the RS-only corp **RSRS**. This was also the birth of BSO’s trademark corp hopping system. **Pro Casuals** was soon retired, with these new corps being added.;

## The Ally System

Just a few months later, BSO came up with another key part of its success - the ally system. Bringing in outsiders to get more and better quality runs, BSO’s server soon became a hotspot, outpacing PRSS and still going to this day.;

## Further Expansion

With BSO doing better than ever, three more dying groups had all their members join BSO’s corps: **B.E.E.R**, **Star Blazers** & **Star Raiders**. Recruitment truly was at its height, and BSO’s White Star domination was evident, with them beating the virtually unbeatable Legion - the top WS corp in the game. Then, even more good news came along. In late 2018, another top corporation, **Path of Hades**, had an internal collapse. Their FO, __silenus__, offered BSO usage of his now semi-defunct corp, becoming a key conglomerate member since **ENFORCERS** had just recently been lost to an inactive FO. Along with **Path of Hades**, the alt corps **G.M.U**, **Prophecy** and **Alt Stars** were integrated, not as full member corps, but simply places for the almost 200 BSO members to store their alt accounts. They are still in function today.

## Order 66

But not all was perfect. __Angrydogies__, an order founder, took his leave in March of 2019, noting the poor RS quality as his reasoning. This sent ripples through the conglomerate, everyone was shocked. BSO leadership decided to act on his words, enacting “Order 66” and kicking almost 50 members. This, however, did not fix the problem. This simply just dropped morale even lower, and along with it White Star quality. A second order founder, __Nyklon__, took his leave at this time too. Around this time, with the advent of corp bonuses, **RSRS** was retired. It was eventually decided that BSO needed to step up its recruitment game once more, opening up the corp **Dauntless**, and bringing in RS 6 & 7 recruitment. This has had a largely positive effect: the next BSO generation is being trained.

## Nowadays

While White Star play may still be recovering, BSO is presently renowned for its strong RS play, boasting over 300 runners, and the first place in the red star event #6. BSO also, in June of 2020, decided once more to look outwards for expansion, bringing in the top corporation **United Galaxies** with __Senofast__ & __TheIronReign__ joining the BSO family. This move brought the total membership up to about 140 members and expanded the order to 5 corporations. Currently, BSO’s CEO is __Wayne-Gro__, and the order keeps growing every day.

## Epilogue

BSO holds the honor of being the first conglomerate created in this game.
Currently, __Ztrata__, __T010__, __Ukrinsky__ and __McChaos__ are the only founders left.
Current BSO Corps: **BlackStar Order**, **Final**, **Trade Station**, **United Galaxies**, **Path of Hades** & **Dauntless**.;
