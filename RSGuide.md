# Red Stars

**Protocol for a cooperative Red Star**

Before going in to an RS
* Decide which corp your group will be running in. Consult the pinned messages in #bso-rs for when and how to do this.
* Declare any liabilities before the scan (e.g. severely wounded BS or low hydro).
* Declare if you need to complete an objective. Everyone should help you complete it or at least not interfere.

**The general rules for sharing artifacts are:**

* Work together as a team. Even if you lose ships, continue helping out as best you can with what you have.
* Communicate well and thoroughly.
* Ping any loosed interceptors.
* We are not PRSS. Default mode is offering full team assistance, not soloing your corner. See point 2.

**The general rules for combat are:**

* Loot as many arts as you are able to during the RS.
* If you ended up with many more arts than someone else (for whatever reason) we encourage you to offer to share them post-run (via diplo or low-level RS). This offer is mandatory in RS7+.
* Running away and not dying is always better than standing strong and wiping. Alive BS are more useful that dead ones, even if you didnt solo that planet you were trying. This becomes more and more critical the higher up in RSes you go.
If you are an Ally, We require you to abide by BSO rules or you're reverted to guest status. If in doubt about anything, ask!

**Red Star 6**

Just like RS5 but with extra collosus and destroyers. Focus on the destroy planets first, EMP the collosus to reset their laser and kill 'em.

**Red Star 7**

Welcome to bombers, if you have not turned on the heat map, turn it on now. Bombers fire rockets into all adjacent sectors and a rocket hit will quickly cause you to wipe, which is why we require Blast shield. 
Suggested order of engagement: Target planets destroyers are going to --> Bombers > Collosus > Rest

**Red Star 8**

Introducing the Phoenix, it packs an area shield, a strong dual laser, and moves around its sector to protect cerbs closest to battleships. You can use this to your advantage, ideally you want to trap a Phoneix just of out firing range as you kill a bomber to drain its area shield and then move into the kill.

**Red Star 9**

Ahh yes, the best RS to be at in game from a gain / hydro spent perspective. You will be here a while, enjoy it. The Storm is the new enemy here and it fires DARTS in a giant radius at all ships in range as it circles the planet. Follow similar engagement to RS8 in regards to Phoenix Area shield. Be careful with your barriers as stacked Storm darts will kill you VERY quick if you dont time barrier dropping right. Order of priority: Storm > Phoenix > Bomber > Collosus.

**Red Star 10**

Say hi to ghosts, they will spawn every 40seconds , then every 20 after 15 minutes. They take 30sec to spawn and will follow the closest player ship as interceptors but they will use the player ship position as a waypoint, no matter if it's moving or not.

__Phase 1__ -- The Clear

All players will focus on catching the destroyers and clearing planets, then enough additional sectors that everyone's influence bar is blue or very close to it. Order of priority: Storm > Phoenix > Bomber > Collosus.

__Phase 2__ -- The Collection

*Check with other players before starting this*; players will each pick a planet to defend from ghosts, and transports will teleport in to load. It is expected that you keep an area shield up and TW on the planet to speed up this process. **Mine at your own risk; transports are the priority.** If you need a croid, please inform the other players at this point. It is better to save those for the second transport trip when there will be BS free to watch them.
